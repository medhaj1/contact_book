/**
 * Outside Click Enhancement Summary
 * 
 * This file documents all the places where efficient outside clicking has been introduced
 * to improve user experience and make the interface more intuitive.
 * 
 * COMPONENTS ENHANCED:
 * 
 * 1. FloatingActionButton (src/components/dashboard/FloatingActionButton.jsx)
 *    - Added outside click to close the "Add Contact" dropdown
 *    - Users can now click anywhere outside to dismiss the floating menu
 * 
 * 2. HeaderSection (src/components/dashboard/HeaderSection.jsx)  
 *    - Added outside click for Export dropdown menu
 *    - Added outside click for User profile dropdown menu
 *    - Removed old manual click-outside handlers
 * 
 * 3. ContactForm (src/components/dashboard/ContactForm.jsx)
 *    - Added outside click to close the modal (clicking backdrop)
 *    - Added escape key support to close the modal
 *    - Modal content clicks don't trigger close (event.stopPropagation)
 * 
 * 4. ImportModal (src/components/dashboard/ImportModal.jsx)
 *    - Added outside click to close the import dialog
 *    - Added escape key support
 *    - Prevents accidental closure while interacting with modal content
 * 
 * 5. CategoryForm (src/components/dashboard/CategoryForm.jsx)
 *    - Added outside click to dismiss the category creation modal
 *    - Includes escape key functionality
 * 
 * 6. ChatPanel (src/components/chat/ChatPanel.jsx)
 *    - Added outside click to close message action menus (three-dot menu)
 *    - Only applies the ref when a menu is actually open for better performance
 * 
 * HOOKS CREATED:
 * 
 * 1. useOutsideClick (src/hooks/useOutsideClick.js)
 *    - Detects clicks outside a referenced element
 *    - Supports exclusion of certain areas from outside click detection
 *    - Works with both mouse and touch events
 * 
 * 2. useEscapeKey (src/hooks/useOutsideClick.js)
 *    - Detects escape key presses
 *    - Can be enabled/disabled
 * 
 * 3. useClickAwayAndEscape (src/hooks/useOutsideClick.js)
 *    - Combines outside click and escape key detection
 *    - One hook for complete dismissal functionality
 * 
 * 4. useModalControls (src/hooks/useOutsideClick.js)
 *    - Specialized hook for modal components
 *    - Supports backdrop clicking and escape key
 *    - Configurable behavior for different modal types
 * 
 * EVENT HANDLING IMPROVEMENTS:
 * 
 * - All outside click handlers are properly cleaned up on unmount
 * - Performance optimized - only active when needed
 * - Supports both desktop (mouse) and mobile (touch) interactions
 * - Prevents interference with legitimate UI interactions
 * - Works with complex nested component structures
 * 
 * USER EXPERIENCE BENEFITS:
 * 
 * ✅ Natural dismissal patterns users expect
 * ✅ Reduced need for explicit close buttons in some cases
 * ✅ Faster interaction workflows
 * ✅ Consistent behavior across all components
 * ✅ Mobile-friendly touch interactions
 * ✅ Keyboard accessibility (escape key)
 * ✅ Prevents UI getting "stuck" in open states
 * 
 * ACCESSIBILITY FEATURES:
 * 
 * - Escape key support for keyboard users
 * - Focus management preserved
 * - Screen reader compatible
 * - Touch device support
 * - No interference with assistive technologies
 * 
 * PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
 * 
 * - Event listeners only attached when components are open
 * - Efficient cleanup prevents memory leaks
 * - Uses passive event listeners where appropriate
 * - Minimal impact on render performance
